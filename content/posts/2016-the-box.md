There once was a king who ruled a kingdom, a very very small singular kingdom. It was nothing
more than a box. A small box with enough room to fit himself, and the king lived alone. The king was
disappointed with his situation, and a great sadness was within him. Occasionally the king would meet
someone outside and they would become friends. However, the king was a very judgmental man and
only saw flaws. Soon he would find a small flaw with his new friend and this flaw would overtake his
vision. Inside on the walls of his box at night he could only see flaws. The familiar flaws of his already sad
and lonely life danced amongst his vision as he focused on the flaw of his newly found friend. He hated
that it was there. 

He knew his friend was good and that they enjoyed each other. Frustrated he tried to
turn away, but it followed his vision and was all he could see. Eventually the friend would notice that the
king had started acting strangely. He would ask the king what was wrong but the king would not say. The
king managed his own issues and refused to trouble the rest of the world with it. Their relationship grew
distant with time and eventually died. The king was again alone, within his kingdom of familiar flaws and
the failure of the friendship rang loud in his ears. His sadness steepened, and along with it came a
certain small satisfaction since his problems, flaws, and sadness were still his to bear alone. The king
looked around at the corners of his small box and nodded. This was his kingdom after all.

I wrote this a few years back after a friendship hit some rocky times. This was my expression of that turbulence and lead to me gaining some understanding. I am still finding my way every day but am trying to lean more and coexist with other in positive ways. I'm not always perfect, but getting better :)
